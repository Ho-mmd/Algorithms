-----------------------------------------

### Why?

- Think it can be solved with sort in algorithm library (Time)
- Think it can be solved with counting sort (Memory)
- Need to think solution about non-algorithm method

-----------------------------------------

### Solution

- Divide C and C++ buffer
- After dividing, can't use  cin/scanf/gets/getchar ...... together 
- After dividing, can't use  cout/printf/puts/putchar ...... together

```
std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
```

- Untie a bundle of 'cin and cout'
- When 'cin' is operating, first try to empty output buffer

```
std::cin.tie(NULL);
// std::cout.tie(NULL);
```
