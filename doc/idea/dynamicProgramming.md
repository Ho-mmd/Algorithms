# Dynamic Programming

- Overlapping Sub_Problem
- Optimal Sub_Structure
- Create a cache to store value (Memoization) and solve problems through recursion or loops

-----------------------------------------

## Top-down

- Solve big problems by breaking them down into smaller problems
- Solved with recursion
